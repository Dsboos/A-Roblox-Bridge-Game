# A-Roblox-Bridge-Game
A fun little game about bridges and stuff I created in Roblox Studio. Really basic stuff but fun mechanics with great scope for expansion.

## Bridges
Simple objects that can be adjusted by length to clear a gap in the map. They grow on left-clicking, shrink on right-clicking, and solidify on pressing E.

## Rollers
Ball-like objects that have similar mechanics to bridges in terms of size control but have added feature of being able to get tugged around by a rope on pressing T.
Used to clear crevices by filling them or for swinging with them to clear large gaps.

## Map
The map is a demo map consisting of one level that showcases all the different mechanics currently being implemented.S
